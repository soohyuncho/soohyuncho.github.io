I am an Assistant Professor of  [Government and Legal Studies](https://www.bowdoin.edu/government/) at Bowdoin College. I was a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at Princeton University's [Niehaus Center for Globalization and Governance](https://niehaus.princeton.edu/). I received my Ph.D. in Political Science in 2023 from Ohio State University. 

My research lies at the intersection of international political economy, gender politics, and political methodology. In broad terms, I investigate the linkages between economic globalization and workers’ experiences in the domestic labor market.  I explore my research agenda through a mix of large-N quantitative analysis, causal inference, survey experiments, Bayesian statistics, and text analysis.  My dissertation, *Three Essays on the Political Economy of International Trade and the Domestic Labor Market*, focuses on firms’ and workers’ responses to economic globalization and the diffusion of social responsibility norms.

I earned my B.A. and M.A. in Political Science from Seoul National University, South Korea. My work has been supported by the Fulbright Fellowship, the [Presidential Fellow at OSU](https://gradsch.osu.edu/presidential-fellowship), and other grants including the APSA Centennial Center Research Grant and the APSA Doctoral Dissertation Research Improvement Grant.
