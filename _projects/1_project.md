1. Protectionism Reconsidered: Economic Insecurity and the Gender Gap in Trade Attitudes
   <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
   <p>While previous research has revealed a gender gap in trade attitudes and the rise of populism and economic protectionism, it has paid less attention to why women continue to support protectionism despite their lack of populist attitudes. The gender gap in trade attitudes has not closed despite the rise of populism, which has taken place particularly among men. Why are women consistently more protectionist than men, and when does men's populism turn into protectionism? I examine the causal process of preference formation across genders using a decomposition analysis, a survey experiment, and structural topic models. I argue that economic insecurity leads both women and men to form protectionist attitudes. My findings suggest that, for women, persistent gender discrimination leads to the perception of negative trade effects on their gender group, fostering protectionism. For men, stochastic trade shocks activate populism, which transforms into protectionism when they perceive adverse trade effects on their country.</p>

2. Measuring Women’s Experiences in Gendered Labor Markets
   <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
   <p>This paper examines whether gender policy indicators (GPIs) accurately reflect women's economic rights in practice. Despite international and state-level efforts, it remains unclear if these legal advancements have improved women's real-world labor market experiences. Existing GPIs often overlook country-specific contexts and latent heterogeneity, leading to an incomplete understanding of gender inequality. To address this gap, I use item response theory (IRT) and Women, Business, and Law (WBL) data to create the Latent Gender Equality (LGE) Index, a time-series cross-sectional measure of gender equality in 187 countries from 1991 to 2017.</p>

3. Automation, Economic Insecurity, and Gendered Social Policy Attitudes: Evidence from South Korea (with Jae-wook Lee)
   <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
   <p>Recent advances in automation have raised concerns about job insecurity, potentially increasing support for social policies. While existing research links policy preferences to individuals’ economic vulnerability, the role of identity—particularly gender—remains underexplored. We argue that automation-driven layoffs do not universally increase support for social protection; rather, their effects are shaped by gender norms. Using a survey experiment in South Korea, we show that automation-driven job loss increases support for an ex-ante protective measure (e.g., Automation Tax) only when male workers are affected. This selective protection reflects the male-breadwinner model, which views male labor as more essential to household income and male job loss as more socially disruptive. The disparity in social policy preferences by laid-off's gender profile is pronounced among individuals who hold sexist attitudes. Our findings reveal how gendered beliefs about labor value shape social protection preferences, highlighting identity-based biases in responses to economic change.</p>
