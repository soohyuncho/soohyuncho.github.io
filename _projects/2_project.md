1. Insecurity and Attitudes toward Globalization: Evidence from Sub-Saharan Africa (with Sarah Brooks)
   <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
   <p>Canonical trade models (Heckscher-Ohlin-Stolper Samuelson) predict that developing countries, rich in low-skilled labor, tend to favor free trade, a view largely confirmed by studies. However, most research on the globalization backlash focuses on advanced industrial nations, overlooking variations within the developing world. Our study addresses this by examining differences between middle-income emerging democracies and poorer developing nations, and by distinguishing between attitudes toward trade and migration. We argue that while developing nations broadly support trade liberalization, middle-income countries may experience discontent over migration, similar to advanced nations. Using a conjoint survey experiment in South Africa and Zimbabwe, we find that South African respondents, from a middle-income nation, express migration preferences akin to those in advanced industrial nations, while maintaining mixed views on trade. This research suggests a need for a more nuanced understanding of globalization, factoring in varying economic contexts and attitudes within developing nations.</p>
